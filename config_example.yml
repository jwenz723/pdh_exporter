# Interval is the number of seconds between each collection iteration

# Counters contains a map of counters to be collected. Within each key-value pair the key represents a case-insensitive
# regex pattern used to match collected hosts that are specified within the HostNames list. Within each key-value pair
# the value contains a list of PDH strings representing the PDH counters that should be collected.
Counters:

    # The key 'localhost' will never match anything because localhost contained in the HostNames list is
    # replaced at runtime by the actual hostname.
    localhost:
        - '\My Category\My Counter'

    # This will match all hosts contained within the HostNames list.
    .*:
        - '\Processor(*)\% Processor Time'

# ExcludeCounters functions the same way as Counters except that anything defined in ExcludeCounters will be removed
# from Counters at run time.
ExcludeCounters:
      .*host2.*:
            - '\My Category\My Counter'

# The names of the hosts to collect counters from. This list should not contain duplicates.
# If duplicates exist, only the first instance of the duplicated item will be processed.
# Note that localhost will be replaced with the actual hostname of the machine executing
# the pdhexport application. Also note that remote collection of PDH counters is unstable when done in large batches.
# Therefore, it is suggested that you run this app locally on each host then collect the data from each
# host using the prometheus /metrics http endpoint.
HostNames:
    - 'localhost' # this will be automatically replaced with the actual hostname
    - 'host2'
